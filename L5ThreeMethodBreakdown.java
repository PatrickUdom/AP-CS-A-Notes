// Question: Write a program that breaks down a task into three methods. Implement a main method that calls three separate methods to perform different parts of the task. Use these methods to demonstrate the breakdown with an example task.
// Example: 
// Part One: Initializing...
// Part Two: Processing...
// Part Three: Finalizing...

public class L5ThreeMethodBreakdown {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        partOne();
        partTwo();
        partThree();
    }

    /**
     * Performs the first part of the task.
     */
    public static void partOne() {
        System.out.println("Part One: Initializing...");
        // ...additional code for part one...
    }

    /**
     * Performs the second part of the task.
     */
    public static void partTwo() {
        System.out.println("Part Two: Processing...");
        // ...additional code for part two...
    }

    /**
     * Performs the third part of the task.
     */
